# Selected Classwork

This repository contains projects (or links to projects) that I completed for various classes 
at Northeastern. The project folder naming conventions is as follows. 

`<semester taken>_<course number>_<project name>`

Each project contains a README which explains more about the assignment and/or the 
report written about the project. There is also an assignment (.mkd or .pdf) file 
that has the assignment instructions. In some projects the REAME may just be the 
assignment. 

## Table of Contents:
|Course         | Project                           | Language/Tech | Description                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|:--------:|------------------------------------------|
| F17\_CS3650   | [Shell][1]                        |     C    | A basic Unix shell implemented in C with support for redirecting outputs and inputs,piping, background operations, `&&` and `\|\|` operations, and the `;` operation.|
| F17\_CS3650   | [MemoryAllocator][2]              |     C    | A memory allocator that uses a number of optimization techniques to improve speed and reduce memory fragmentation. These techniques included binning, thread specific arenas, large upfront allocations, and a memory mailbox system|
| F17\_CS3650   | [Filesystem][3]                   |     C    | A 1MB fuse file system with support for reading and writing small files (under 4kB), deleting, renaming, and linking files, nested directories, and support for large files|
| F17\_EECE2560 | [Wordsearch][4]                   |    C++/OpenMP   | Given a grid of random characters and a list of words representing valid words to find, the wordsearch project finds all the given words  in the wordsearch. Project focused on optimizing our algorithm for the best possible runtime.|
| S18\_CS3500   | [Animator][8]                     |  Java    | A project focused on OOD principles and practices, focusing on a MVC pattern. The goal of this project was to take an input file representing an animation and produce three different representations of the animation: a text view, a SVG view, a visual view, and a interactive view. |
| S18\_EECE5698 | [GPS Analysis][6]                 |  Matlab/Python/LCM  | An analysis of GPS error characteristics and performance comparision between RTK and non-RTK GPS. |
| S18\_EECE5698 | [Dead Reckoning Analysis][7]      |  Matlab/Python/ROS  | Compared the estimated position over time of a car driven through Boston calculated using dead reckoning to a ground truth given by GPS. |
| S18\_EECE5698 | [FollowBot][5]                    |  Python/ROS/OpenCV  | ROS Nodes used for a person following robot in python using a number of person detectors including a HoG detector (camera), MobileNetSSD (camera), and a lidar based detector. |
