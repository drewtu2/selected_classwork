# Selected Classwork

This repository contains projects that I completed for various classes at
Northeastern. The project folder naming conventions is as follows. 

`<semester taken>_<course number>_<project name>`

Each project contains a README which explains more about the assignment and/or the 
report written about the project. There is also an assignment (.mkd or .pdf) file 
that has the assignment instructions. In some projects the REAME may just be the 
assignment.

| Project                           | Language | Description                              |
|-----------------------------------|:--------:|------------------------------------------|
| [F17\_CS3650\_Shell][1]           |     C    | A basic Unix shell implemented in C with support for redirecting outputs and inputs, piping, background operations, `&&` and `\|\|` operations, and the `;` operation.|
| [F17\_CS3650\_MemoryAllocator][2] |     C    | A memory allocator that uses a number of optimization techniques to improve speed and reduce memory fragmentation. Thesetechniques including binning, thread specific arenas, large upfront allocations, and a memory mailbox system|
| [F17\_CS3650\_Filesystem][3]      |     C    | A 1MB fuse file system with support for reading and writing small files (under 4kB), deleting, renaming, and linking files, nested directories, and support for large files|
| [F17\_EECE2560\_Wordsearch][4]    |    C++   | Given a grid of random characters and a list of words representing valid words to find, the wordsearch project finds all the given words in the wordsearch. Project focused on optimizing our algorithm for the best possible runtime.|
